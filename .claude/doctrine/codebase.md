# Codebase doctrine

Load-bearing project rules every agent operating in this repo must respect.
Both the coordinator and every worker inherit this. This is a generic seed
installed by `exophial init`; once installed it is free to drift from
exophial's own copy to match this repo's actual conventions.

## Behavioral norms (inherited from principal)

Full doctrine: [`principal.md`](principal.md). Load-bearing summary:

- Evidence-based reasoning: run before you read, when diagnosing.
- Fail fast, no fallbacks: no retry loops, no silent catch-all.
- Done = integrated + end-to-end verified, against the real surface.
- Own your consequences: grep for orphans before declaring a change done.

## Literate code principle

An agent should be able to derive all the state needed to safely modify a file
from three sources:

1. **Directory structure** — the layout tells you what exists and how it's
   organized.
2. **Imports within the file** — these declare the file's dependencies
   explicitly.
3. **Comments within the file** — these link to prose design docs that explain
   the *why*, not the *what* (well-named identifiers already say the what).

If a file is changed, any documentation that references it is potentially
stale and must be checked — documentation and code are a bidirectional graph.

## Functional core, imperative shell

Pure functions compute; IO (network, filesystem, subprocess, print) happens
only at the boundary. A function that does both is wrong — decompose it
before writing it. Small functions: if one is long, it does too much.

## DRY / KISS

Minimize duplication and complexity. Don't add abstractions beyond what the
task requires — three similar lines beat a premature abstraction. Don't design
for hypothetical future requirements.

## Own your consequences

If you move code, verify nothing still imports the old location. If you delete
a caller, delete the callee. The person making a change is responsible for
everything that change breaks — not just its immediate correctness, but its
ongoing cost.

## Testing

Testing conventions (unit vs. integration vs. e2e, and per-surface detail) are
owned by [`testing.md`](testing.md) — read it before writing or reviewing any
test in this repo. Do not restate the taxonomy here; that duplication is
exactly how conflicting definitions drift apart.

## Roles

- [`coordinator.md`](coordinator.md) — the role dispatching and integrating
  work across workers.
- [`worker.md`](worker.md) — the role executing one task in an isolated
  worktree.

## Runner builds (muster)

This section is muster's own; it is not in exophial's seed.

`make build`, the standalone runner, is the heaviest command in this repo, and
its memory goes to flake **evaluation**, not compilation. On 2026-10-05 the
`nix` client alone reached 7.4 GB RSS while evaluating, before any derivation
built. With other sessions' processes already resident, the kernel OOM-killed
the operator's desktop apps, and the operator was logged out mid-meeting. This
happened twice. `--max-jobs`/`--cores` did not help: they limit only the build
phase, and builds run under nix-daemon, which a client-side `nice` never
reaches.

- **Ask before starting one.** The timing of a runner build on the operator's
  workstation is the operator's call. Never start one unannounced in the
  background.
- **Keep it under a hard memory cap**, so that only the build dies if it runs
  over, not the session. `make build`, `make build-lgx` and `make appimage`
  apply the cap themselves: their nix calls run in a `systemd-run --user
  --scope` capped at `BUILD_MEM`. Each refuses to start if the cap can't be
  applied, and says so when the build is killed at the cap. `BUILD_MEM`
  defaults to `10G`, except on the hosts in the Makefile's `UNCAPPED_HOSTS`
  (today `bugger`, which has memory to spare), where it defaults to uncapped.
  Add a host there only when it really has the headroom. `BUILD_MEM=` builds
  uncapped on any host; that is a deliberate choice, never a workaround for a
  refused cap. A flake evaluated any other way (`nix build`/`nix run` by hand,
  `make run`) is not capped, so on a capped host wrap it yourself:

  ```bash
  systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=10G -p MemorySwapMax=0 nice -n 19 <command>
  ```

  The scope holds the evaluating `nix` process. Size the cap to what the host
  can spare with everything else running. If the build dies at the cap, it
  needs a quieter host or a quieter hour, not a higher cap on a busy one.
- **Reuse an existing runner when the change touches nothing compiled into
  it.** That means no change under `module/src`, `module/nim-lib`,
  `module/metadata.json`, `ui/src`, or any `flake.nix`/`flake.lock`. A check
  that drives a runner (`scripts/audit-download-self-test.sh`, and so
  `scripts/grade-specs.sh exo-403`) can then run against an existing build:
  `ln -sfn "$(readlink -f <main checkout>/.run/runner)" .run/runner`, run
  under the same cap. Say in the PR which runner the check ran against, and
  remove the link afterwards so that no later session mistakes it for this
  branch's build.

## Side repos (muster)

This section is muster's own; it is not in exophial's seed.

Muster work sometimes needs a repo that exophiald does not integrate: no daemon
merges into its `main`, and no pebble's worker owns its branches. The integrator
guard (`exophial hook block_worktree_leak`, wired in this repo's
`.claude/settings.json`) still checks every Bash command a muster session runs,
including one that `cd`s into such a repo, so without this rule nothing could
ever advance that repo's `main`.

- **In a listed side repo, mark the one command.** The guarded git operations
  (push or merge to `main`, creating or moving a branch) may carry the
  integrator marker inline on that command alone, after the `cd` into the side
  repo:

  ```bash
  cd /home/petty/logos-signer-module && EXOPHIALD_INTEGRATOR=1 git push -u origin main
  ```

  Never in muster or any of its worktrees, never exported into the
  environment, and never for a repo the table below does not list.
- **The list is the operator's.** A repo joins it only when the operator says
  so, recorded here with the date and what the repo holds. A fork carrying a
  feature branch for upstream (`corpetty/logos-*`) is not a side repo: its
  branches push without the marker, and its `main` is upstream's.

| Repo | Local checkout | Holds | Listed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `corpetty/logos-signer-module` | `/home/petty/logos-signer-module` | specs and pebbles for the platform signer work (epic exo-833) | 2026-10-25, by the operator |

**Two guard defects this rule works around**, until they are fixed in exophial:
1. **The guard reads the session's repo, not the command's.** Its topology (main
   checkout, worktrees, configured remotes) comes from the muster checkout even
   when the command runs in another repo. So a side repo's push is judged
   against muster's remotes and worktrees.
2. **`-u` defeats the publish carve-out (exo-896.3).** The carve-out allows a
   plain `git push <remote> main` to a configured remote, but it takes the
   first argument as the remote, so `git push -u origin main` reads `-u` as the
   remote and is denied.
