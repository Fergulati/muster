# Muster — run the real client (module/ + ui/).
#
# `make run` launches the STANDALONE app: logos-standalone-app hosting the muster
# UI + muster_module directly, no logos-basecamp and no package manager. Verified
# 2026-08-24 to render the dashboard and the six-step walkthrough offscreen.
#
# Prefer basecamp? See ui/tests/README.md § "Producing the app-under-test".
#
# A fresh clone builds: every flake input is a GitHub ref. module/flake.nix pins
# logos-module-builder to the corpetty fork (the nim.packages hook + a RUNPATH fix,
# upstream-pending in logos-co/logos-module-builder#226), and ui/flake.nix reaches
# muster_module inside the clone (`build` below overrides it to this clone's absolute
# path at build time). Tests: module/tests/run-suite.sh (module/tests/README.md).
