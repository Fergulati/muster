## The room as tracker (exo-4d0.4, docs/design/room-swarm.md §5.3): which files the room
## shares, and which members seed each one, as log events folded by `reduceSwarm`.
##
##   file/<fid>                 a share: name, mime, size, the plaintext digest, the
##                              ciphertext CID, the file key, the seal scheme, the storage
##                              network — in the sharer's name ("author")
##   file/<fid>/seed/<who>      a member's announce: seeding or not ("on"), how to reach
##                              their storage node (peer id, addresses, network)
##   file/<fid>/retract         the sharer hides the file from the room's list
##
## Every `file/` event names its author and carries their signature (authorship.nim), so
## the room's view drops one in anyone else's name: a member is a seeder only because they
## said so (invariant 9), and the client never infers a holder from what a storage node
## sees. The fold is a pure, order-free function of the events (invariant 4): a seeder's
## newest announce wins by (at, event id), the same on every member.
##
## The file id is content-addressed over (sharer, CID), so every member agrees on it and no
## member can post under another's file id. Sharing the same blob again — into a later
## epoch, for members admitted since (invariant 7) — is a new share in the re-sharer's own
## name with the same CID and key: the member disclosing what they legitimately hold.
##
## The share carries the key in the clear INSIDE the room: the event is sealed to the
## epoch it was published in, so only that epoch's members open it. Nothing here touches
## Storage; the hosted layer (S4) uploads, fetches and opens blobs.
