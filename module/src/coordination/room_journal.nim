## A room's own copy on the member's machine (exo-dcc.14). Muster rebuilt a room from the
## store and the keystore alone, so the fleet's retention was the room's lifetime. Each
## member now keeps the frames it has seen, still sealed exactly as they travel, and
## rebuilds the room from them plus its keys (invariant 4: log + keys); the store becomes
## catch-up, not the only copy.
##
## What is kept: data frames (epoch-sealed events) and grant frames (each sealed whole to
## one member's X25519, so they open without any epoch key). Grants are replayed first, so
## a later epoch's data opens on replay. Beacons, join requests and invites are not the
## room's state and are not kept. Nothing is decrypted here and nothing new is stored in
## the clear: the file holds what a store node already holds.
##
## Format: records of a 4-byte little-endian length and the frame. Appended, one write per
## frame; a torn tail (a crash mid-write) reads as the frames before it.
##
## Pure Nim (os, sets, sha256) — headless-testable; the hosted module wires the path in.
