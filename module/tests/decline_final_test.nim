## A decline is final (exo-720, the operator's Part A review 2026-10-11): a member who
## declined does not approve, and a proposal too many of its possible signers declined is
## declined. Before, a decline was informational: the card showed "2 declined: Bob, you" and
## still offered Approve, and approvals after it counted.
##
##   1. a decliner's approval counts toward nothing, whichever arrived first, and the card's
##      approval count agrees with the fold;
##   2. a 2-of-3 is declined once two of its signers declined; one decline leaves it open;
##   3. a decline by someone the driver does not name as a signer closes nothing;
##   4. once the room has submitted, a decline that raced it changes nothing;
##   5. an approval by a secp key is the decliner's only through a binding that key signed:
##      nobody voids another's approval by binding that person's address to themselves.
## Order-free throughout (invariant 4): every check runs on the events and their reverse.
