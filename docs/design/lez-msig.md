# lez-msig: an M-of-N multisig on LEZ, private by default, run from a muster room

Status: **design, 2026-10-23** (epic exo-0d3; RFP-005, `logos-co/rfp`
`RFPs/RFP-005-multisig-and-coordination.md`). Read against LEZ v0.3.1 (`1a003bf`, = `main`) and
`dev` @ `7cba743a` (the actor model, PR #935). Every LEZ fact below was read in that source; the
citations are in the research notes this was written from (§9).

This supersedes the vote-locus program (`lez.multisig-program`, `docs/design/lez-multisig-v03.md`)
for new multisigs. That program stays readable, but it is public by construction: every vote is
a public transaction naming its member.

## 1. The shape

- **One program, one account.** A multisig is ONE program-derived account (a PDA of the program
  and a seed from its create key). The program's shard of it holds the configuration and state;
  its native shard is the vault. Nothing is claimed and members need no setup.
- **Signatures, not seats.** Each member holds a per-multisig **approval key** (BIP-340,
  secp256k1), derived in their own keystore and never exported. Proposals and approvals never
  touch the chain: they are signed in the room. One transaction executes an action, carrying the
  proposal and its approvals, and the program verifies them **inside its own execution** (R.1).
  LEZ's PR #1001 manual lists this as the alternative to seats: seats cost 2k proofs per action,
  signatures one.
- **Posture is placement, not a program fork.** The same program runs over a **public** PDA (the
  public posture) or a **group-owned private PDA** (the private posture, the default). A private
  execution is one privacy-preserving transaction: fee-exempt on v0.3, no public signer, the
  program's image undisclosed.
- **Rules in a core crate.** `msig_core` holds every rule and depends on no LEZ crate. A thin
  adapter maps it onto v0.3's `run_program(plan, apply)` (deployable today; the testnet runs
  v0.3). A second adapter maps it onto `dev`'s actor handler when that settles (exo-1e7).

## 2. The account

| | seed | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| program `P` | — | the program's account id (its `program_loader` header on v0.3) |
| the multisig `A` | `S = tagged("muster-msig/v1/state", create_key)` | public: `for_public_pda(P, S)`; private: `for_private_pda(P, S, npk, vpk, identifier)` with the group's keys |
| `(A, P)` shard | | `State` (§3), borsh |
| `(A, native)` shard | | the vault's balance |

**The program checks its own address.** Every instruction carries the multisig's *placement*:
`Public`, or `Private { npk, vpk, identifier }`. The plan re-derives `A` from `(P, S)` and the
placement, and refuses unless the state row is exactly that account. This is the
counterfeit-state defence. Without it, anyone could write a `State` naming another multisig's
create key at an account they control, and the program would grant that multisig's seed. For a
private PDA, an observer never sees the placement: instruction data stays inside the proof.

**Not drainable before initialisation.** Every instruction but `Create` requires an initialised
`State`, so funds sent to `A` before `Create` stay put. `Create` writes `State` once, into an
empty shard, at the address its placement derives.

**Group keys (private posture).** `npk`/`vsk`/`nsk` for `A` come from a Group Master Secret
(`SSK = H(dom ‖ GMS ‖ image_id ‖ S)`). Members receive the GMS sealed to their encryption
identity inside the room. The GMS lets a member **operate** the multisig (read it, build an
execution) but not **spend**: a PDA has no spending key, and the program grants `S` only after
the rules pass. The shared secret is a liveness tool, not a trust assumption about funds.

## 3. State

```
State {
  version: 1,
  zone: [u8;32],              // the zone tag, fixed at Create (§4, invariant 2)
  create_key: [u8;32],
  epoch: u64,                 // the config epoch: +1 on every configuration change (R.2)
  members: Vec<Member>,       // ≤ 32, distinct keys
  threshold: u32,             // the total weight of distinct approvers an action needs
  timelock_ms: u64,           // 0 = execute at once
  open_execution: bool,       // false: an EXECUTE member signs the execution too
  limits: Vec<SpendingLimit>, // ≤ 8
  usage: Vec<LimitUsage>,     // per limit: the period and what it has spent in it
  nonce_base: u64,            // nonces below are spent
  consumed: [u8; 32],         // a bitmap over nonce_base .. nonce_base+256
  queue: Vec<Queued>,         // ≤ 16 time-locked actions
}
Member        { key: [u8;32] /* BIP-340 x-only */, roles: u8 /* PROPOSE|APPROVE|EXECUTE */, weight: u16 }
SpendingLimit { id: u32, signers: Vec<[u8;32]>, threshold: u8, amount: u128, period_ms: u64 }
Queued        { nonce: u64, proposal_id: [u8;32], eta_ms: u64, expires_ms: u64 }
```

**Replay.** Every proposal names a nonce. Executing, queuing or cancelling it sets that nonce's
bit, and the window slides once the lowest bit is set. A nonce is used once, proposals may land
in any order inside the 256-nonce window, and the state stays bounded. No marker accounts are
needed.

## 4. What is signed

Every hash is a BIP-340 tagged hash, `tagged(t, m) = SHA256(SHA256(t) ‖ SHA256(t) ‖ m)`, over
borsh bytes.

```
Proposal { multisig: A, zone, epoch, nonce, action: Action, expires_ms, proposer: key }
proposal_id = tagged("muster-msig/v1/proposal", borsh(Proposal))
approval    = BIP-340 over tagged("muster-msig/v1/approve", proposal_id)
execution   = BIP-340 over tagged("muster-msig/v1/execute", proposal_id)   // when !open_execution
spend       = BIP-340 over tagged("muster-msig/v1/spend",   borsh(Spend { multisig: A, zone, epoch, limit, nonce, to, amount, expires_ms }))
```

The digest commits to **environment** (the zone tag), **account** (`A`), **slot** (epoch and
nonce) and **expiry**, which is muster's invariant 2 and RFP R.1's "exactly the action".

The zone tag is set at `Create` and is checked against every proposal. A LEZ message commits to
no chain id. The tag stops a multisig created twice on two zones, with the same program and
create key, from accepting each other's approvals. It cannot separate two replicas of one
chain's history; nothing can.

```
Action =
  | Transfer { to, amount }                      // native, out of the vault (custody_transfer)
  | Call { program, rows: Vec<(account, program)>, data }   // any program; granted S only
  | Config(Vec<ConfigChange>)                    // Add/Remove member, SetRoles, SetWeight,
                                                 // SetThreshold, SetTimelock, SetOpenExecution,
                                                 // AddLimit, RemoveLimit
  | Cancel(Vec<u64>)                             // nonces: unqueue and spend them
```

`Call` never targets the multisig program itself. It is granted exactly `S`, the multisig's own
seed, so it can act as `A` and as nothing else. The published v0.2.4 program let a quorum pass
any seed (exo-325).

## 5. Instructions and the rules

| instruction | the rules (all in `msig_core`) |
|---|---|
| `Create { create_key, zone, config }` | `A` is the PDA its placement derives; the shard is empty; the config is valid (below) |
| `Execute { proposal, approvals, executor?, at_ms }` | the proposal is for `A`, this zone and **this epoch**; the nonce is unspent and in the window; the proposer is a PROPOSE member and signed; the distinct APPROVE signers' weight ≥ threshold; every signature verifies; if `!open_execution`, an EXECUTE member signed the execution; the time lock is 0, or the action is a `Cancel`; the nonce is spent; then the action runs |
| `Queue { proposal, approvals, executor?, at_ms }` | the same checks; the time lock is > 0; the nonce is spent; `Queued { eta = at_ms + timelock }`, with `eta < expires` |
| `ExecuteQueued { proposal, executor?, at_ms }` | a queue entry has this nonce and `proposal_id`, and `at_ms ≥ eta`; it is removed and the action runs. **The epoch is not re-checked** (the R.2 cutoff is the queue) |
| `Spend { spend, approvals, at_ms }` | the limit exists; at least its threshold of its own signers signed, all distinct; the period `p = at_ms / period_ms` has `used + amount ≤ amount` (the counter resets when `p` advances); the nonce is spent; the native transfer runs. No time lock |

**Time.** A program reads no clock. Every `at_ms` is a claim the plan binds with a validity window
the sequencer enforces:

- `Execute`: `[ —, expires )`.
- `Queue`: `[ —, at_ms ]`. The transaction lands no later than `at_ms`, so `eta = at_ms + timelock`
  is at least the real queue time plus the lock: pessimistic, never early.
- `ExecuteQueued`: `[ at_ms, expires )` with `at_ms ≥ eta`.
- `Spend`: `[ p·period, (p+1)·period ) ∩ [ —, expires )`.

Windows are public even in a private transaction, so clients round them to the minute.

**A valid config.**
- 1 ≤ n ≤ 32 members, with distinct keys and every weight ≥ 1.
- 1 ≤ threshold ≤ the total weight of the APPROVE members.
- At least one PROPOSE member, and, unless `open_execution`, at least one EXECUTE member.
- Each limit's signers are members, with 1 ≤ k ≤ |signers|, a period > 0 and an amount > 0.
- Limit ids are distinct; at most 8 limits.
- `timelock_ms` ≤ 365 days.

A config change whose result is invalid is refused whole. Removing a member who signs for a limit
is refused unless the same change removes or replaces that limit.

**Roles (RFP F.6), and what each guarantees.**
- **PROPOSE.** The program refuses an action its proposer did not sign. A proposing key need not
  be an approving key: the proposer's signature counts toward the threshold only if they hold
  APPROVE.
- **APPROVE.** Only APPROVE signatures count, weighted.
- **EXECUTE.** With `open_execution` off, the program refuses an execution an EXECUTE member did
  not sign. In the private posture, executing also needs the group keys to build the proof, so it
  is limited to whoever holds the GMS whatever the role says.

**R.2, precisely.**
- Every approval commits to the epoch. Any config change bumps the epoch, so every approval
  gathered before it stops counting at once.
- The cutoff is **the queue**. An action already queued stays executable after a later config
  change, member removal included.
- The current quorum can `Cancel` it at once: cancels are never time-locked. The UI offers the
  cancel alongside every removal that leaves a queued action behind.
- What a removed member can still do: see §7.

**Error messages (U.7).** Every refusal is a `MsigError` with a stable code and a sentence
(`stale-epoch: approvals were gathered under epoch 3; the multisig is at epoch 4`). The host runs
the program locally before proving (§6), so a refusal shows up in seconds, not after a proof.

## 6. Executing

- **Public posture.** Anyone may send the transaction and pay its fee; muster sends it from the
  executing member's own funded account. Members' approval keys and every action are public.
- **Private posture.** A member holding the GMS builds one privacy-preserving transaction:
  - It consumes `A`'s note and writes its new one.
  - The recipient's credit is a private Init (hidden), or a deferred public effect (amount and
    payee visible).
  - The program's image claim is **Undisclosed**: the program is deployed immutable, so a claim
    says only "some immutable program".

  Before proving, the host executes it with no proof and reports any refusal. Proving takes
  minutes and runs in the background with visible progress. Every execution consumes `A`, so
  executions serialise, and a proof built against a stale `A` is rebuilt.

**The prover is a Logos module, `lez_msig_module`** (`programs/lez-msig/module`, built — exo-efa).
It wraps `msig_host::exec::exec_request`, the same function the `msig_exec` CLI runs, so the two
cannot drift. It holds no key:
- `exec` takes the program's instruction (`msig_core::Instruction`, borsh), the group secret and
  `A`'s current note. It reads the note's membership proof from the user's sequencer, proves,
  sends, and answers with a job; `job` then gives the hash and the new note.
- `fund` proves a deposit, a native transfer from a member's public account into `A`, from the
  payer's public key alone. It answers with the message hash to sign. The member's keystore
  signs it, and `send` checks the signature against the message, then sends.
- One proof runs at a time on its own thread. A job is readable only by the caller that
  submitted it, and `forget` drops its decrypted note.

In muster, `wallet/msig_prover.nim` is the seam (`MsigProver`), `msig_prover_lp.nim` reaches the
module over `lp_*`, and `CliMsigProver` runs `msig_exec` for tests without a host.
`wallet/lez_msig_private.nim`'s `MsigPrivate` is the public chain seam with three differences:
- it reads the state from the newest note;
- it sends through the prover;
- it follows a job, then its transaction.

So the settlement's rules (approvals, epoch, nonce, time lock) are one piece of code for both
postures. A refusal surfaces while proving, and nothing is sent.

## 7. What each observer sees (U.5, Privacy 1–3)

**Private posture.**

| item | chain | store node / fleet | room member | removed member |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| existence | no (a nullifier and a commitment per execution) | no | yes | yes |
| member set, threshold | no | no | yes | until migration (state is readable with the GMS) |
| who approved | no | no | yes (signed in the room) | until migration |
| pending proposals | no | no | yes | until the room re-keys them out (immediately, F-16) |
| action payload | no; a public payee's credit shows payee and amount | no | yes | until migration |
| vault balance | no | no | yes | until migration |
| execution linkage | unlinkable notes; window bounds are public | timing of room traffic | yes | — |
| coordination content | no | no (sealed) | yes | no, from the epoch after removal (F-16) |
| co-signing graph | no | room traffic metadata; mixnet is opt-in (`mix`) | yes | what they saw |

- **Removal.** Removing a member re-keys the room forward at once (F-16). The GMS cannot be
  revoked, so the removed member can still *read* the multisig's state, and can *stall* it by
  consuming `A`, until the remaining members **migrate**:
  1. create a new multisig under a new GMS;
  2. move the vault to it with a `Transfer` the old quorum approves.

  They can never *spend*.
- **Correlation across layers (Privacy-3).**
  - Room messages and executions are separate traffic. An observer of both sees the room's sends,
    which the store node sees as sealed envelopes on one topic, and executions at about the same
    time.
  - Nothing on chain names the room. The binding between a member's LEZ identity and their room
    identity exists only inside the room (§8).

**Public posture.** Everything except coordination content is public; that stays in the room.

**Selective disclosure (§ Privacy Architecture 2–3).**
- **A narrow audience.** Give an auditor the PDA's viewing key. On v0.3 that is `(nsk, vsk)`:
  they can read and also stall. On `dev` the viewing secret is separate from `nsk`, so they can
  read only.
- **A wide audience.** Muster's signature-audit export (`coordination/audit.nim`) gives the
  room's record of who approved what, verifiable from the file alone.
- **Ongoing assurance.** Re-export at any time. A disclosure shows `A`'s current commitment, and
  the receiver checks it against the chain's commitment set.
- **What an audience learns.** Everything the key decrypts, from then on.

## 8. The room (F.9, S.2)

The coordination room is muster's room. Each multisig is created *from* a room.

1. **Bind.** Each member derives an approval key in their keystore (label
   `lez-msig/<room>/<n>`) and discloses it in the room. The disclosure is author-signed by their
   room identity, and the approval key signs the room's binding statement back. So the binding
   is mutual and lives only in the room.
2. **Create.** The creator assembles the config from the disclosed keys and generates the GMS.
   They send `Create` (public posture), or prove it (private). Then they seal the GMS to each
   member in the room.
3. **Propose / approve.** A proposal is a room intent whose effect is the `Proposal`. An approval
   is a room contribution carrying the BIP-340 signature. The driver re-derives `proposal_id` from
   the effect and verifies the signature against the member's disclosed key, the same checks the
   program will make (invariant 1). The room holds no authority over validity: the program's
   check is the only one that counts.
4. **Execute / queue / cancel.** Any member with the keys settles. The card shows the queue's ETA
   and the expiry.
5. **Reconcile.** On every executed config change, the room's membership follows the program's.
   A removed member is evicted and the room re-keys forward. An added member is admitted (after
   they disclose a key).

**Approval keys from accounts members shared (built, exo-1f9).** By default each member's
client derives a fresh approval key for each multisig. A member may instead share an account
of their own with the room (`coordinate_disclose_my_account`): its key signs a hash-input
record of (room, member, chain, kind, key), so it counts only for that member and only in
this room, and the disclosure is author-signed. The opener may then pick, for any member, one
of the accounts that member shared (`lez_msig_open {accounts}`). A picked account counts as
that member's join. Their client finds its keystore label by deriving its own candidates
(`crypto/account_labels.nim`), so the room never sees a label. The cost is linkability: the
public posture puts every member key on chain at creation, so one account used in several
multisigs links them. The fresh key stays the default.

**The private posture in the room (built, exo-efa).** The opener's `lez_msig_open {private:
true}` generates the GMS and seals one copy to each invited member's room identity. Each copy is
author-signed, and only the opener's counts:
- `lmsig/<ck>/gms/<member>` carries the sealed GMS.
- The opener's client creates the multisig through the prover. Once the chain includes the
  Create, the client seals the note, the multisig's decrypted account, to every member as
  `lmsig/<ck>/note/0/<member>`. It then discloses the account with placement `private`.
- After every later transaction the chain includes, the member who sent it seals note `n+1`.
  Only one transaction can spend note `n` (its nullifier), so each number has one note.

Every member reads the multisig from the newest note. No one scans the chain, and anyone else in
the room holds no copy. A member holding the GMS checks the disclosed address through the
prover's `derive`; to the rest of the room it reads as unknown.

**Recovery (built, exo-abc).** A member who landed a transaction may go away before sealing
its note. The prover's `scan` then reads every block's private actions and decrypts the
multisig's notes with the group's viewing key; the newest is the state, because each spends the
one before. The finding member seals it into the room like any other note. It starts by itself
when a private settlement fails, and a member can start it ("Read it from the chain";
`lez_msig_recover`). It sends nothing.

A payment's credit to a public payee is a deferred public effect, so it can land a block after
the multisig's note. Muster judges the multisig by its note and never by the payee's balance.

What is not built:
- **Real proving from a room.** The room flow has run in dev mode only
  (`module/tests/lez_msig_private_e2e.nim`). Real proving is measured in §10.

Every view of the room is the fold over its signed log.

- **What a participant can do against the room.** Withhold, reorder, replay, inject, or show
  members different views.
- **Why it does not matter for validity.** The program re-verifies everything. Replay is spent by
  the nonce, injection has no valid signature, and a stale view yields approvals for a stale
  epoch, which the program refuses.
- **What remains is liveness.** A member can withhold their own approval, which is their right,
  or refuse to relay.

**S.2 says the chat module; this is a deliberate deviation.**
- Chat 0.3.0 has no member removal, so the reconciliation above cannot be done.
- It sends the room id in the clear.
- It registers key packages with a central HTTP service.
- Muster's room has forward re-keying on admission (F-16), a sealed topic the store node cannot
  attribute (exo-661.7), and an exportable proof (`log/proof.nim`).

The `ConversationCrypto` seam is where a chat-module binding goes once chat ships removal
(ADR-010).

## 9. Decision log (S.14)

| # | decision | options | chosen, because |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | how members approve | seats (an actor per member, 2k proofs); on-chain votes (the v0.3 port); off-chain signatures verified in-program | signatures: one proof per action, no member on chain, and the room is already a signed log |
| D2 | where state and funds live | separate state and vault PDAs; one PDA, two shards | one PDA: one note to consume, one address to check |
| D3 | approval scheme | ed25519 (`sequencer_stake`'s); BIP-340 | BIP-340: muster's keystore signs it, and with risc0's accelerated k256 (patched in our guest only) about 0.28M cycles per verify against several million for unaccelerated ed25519 on v0.3 |
| D4 | replay | consumed-id set; initialise-once marker accounts; nonce + 256-bit window | the window: bounded state, any order, no extra accounts in a private transaction |
| D5 | the R.2 cutoff | at execution; **at queue**; any change voids all | at queue, with immediate cancels: a time lock is a promise to the members, and the current quorum can still stop it |
| D6 | time | the clock program; validity windows | windows: no extra accounts, and a pessimistic ETA |
| D7 | posture | two programs; placement | placement: one audited program, and the posture is the account kind |
| D8 | runtime | v0.3 only; `dev` only; a core plus adapters | core plus adapters: v0.3 is what runs today, `dev` is what 0.4 will run, and it is still moving |
| D9 | the coordination layer | chat_module 0.3.0; muster's room | muster's room, until chat ships removal (§8) |
| D10 | counterfeit state | trust the state row; re-derive `A` from the placement in the plan | re-derive, refusing any other row (§2) |
| D11 | removal | revoke (impossible, there is no key revocation); migrate | migrate, with the GMS's limits documented (§7) |
| D12 | spending limits | any asset; native only | native first; a token limit is a `Call` whose decoded amount the limit would have to trust, which waits on the registry (U.6) |

## 10. Measured (RFP P.1, P.2)

`programs/lez-msig/BENCHMARKS.md`, real proving, 2026-10-23, on a 64-core CPU:

- A private payment carrying M approvals proves in 150.7 s at M = 1, 208.5 s at M = 5, and
  288.1 s at M = 10: about 15 s per approval.
- The transaction is a constant 228 KB.
- RISC Zero's accelerated k256 is 2.9× faster than stock (439 s at M = 1).

M ≥ 5 is viable. The ceiling is the 32-member limit, not the block.
