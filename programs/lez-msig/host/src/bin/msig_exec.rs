//! The private posture's executor (docs/design/lez-msig.md §6): one JSON request on stdin, one
//! JSON answer on stdout. Muster builds and signs everything it can (the proposal, the
//! approvals, the instruction's bytes); this proves the program's execution over the
//! multisig's private note and sends it, because proving needs LEZ's own Rust prover.
//!
//! Requests (every hex string lowercase, no 0x):
//!   {"mode":"derive","program","gms","createKey"}
//!       → {"account"}: the multisig's private PDA, which only a holder of the group secret can
//!         derive (its keys are part of the address).
//!   {"mode":"exec","rpc","program","gms","createKey","pre":<Account borsh> | null,"op":<msig_core::Instruction borsh>}
//!       → {"hash","post":<Account borsh>,"account","proveMs"}: proved against the chain's
//!         membership proof for `pre` (null for Create, an Init) and sent. `post` is the new
//!         note in plaintext, as a member decrypts it. Muster carries it, sealed, in the room,
//!         so every member can execute next without scanning the chain.
//!   {"mode":"fund","rpc","program","gms","createKey","pre","payerKey","payerNonce","amount"}
//!       → {"sign","payer","message","proof","post","account","root","proveMs"}: a deposit from
//!         the payer's public account, proved but not sent. The payer signs `sign` (BIP-340 over
//!         the message's hash) in their own keystore; nothing here holds a key.
//!   {"mode":"scan","rpc","program","gms","createKey","from"?} → {"found","post","block","hash","scanned"}:
//!         the multisig's newest note, read from the chain with the group's viewing key.
//!   {"mode":"send","rpc","message","proof","witnesses":[{"signature","publicKey"}]} → {"hash"}:
//!         a proved message sent with its signatures, each checked first.
//! Errors: {"error","detail"}. A refusal the program makes surfaces as its MsigError code at
//! proving time, before anything is sent (RFP U.7).
//!
//! `RISC0_DEV_MODE` decides whether proofs are real; a dev-mode zone accepts dev receipts only.
